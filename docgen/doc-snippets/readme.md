Official Node.js SDK for [PubPub](https://pubpub.org/).

## Contents

## Installation

If you use the SDK in Node, you must use Node 18 or higher in order to support native FormData.

```bash
pnpm add @pubpub/sdk
# yarn add @pubpub/sdk
# npm install @pubpub/sdk
```

## Usage

```ts
import { PubPub } from '@pubpub/sdk'

const communityUrl = 'https://demo.pubpub.org'

async function main() {
  const pubpub = await PubPub.createSDK({
    communityUrl,
    email: '...',
    password: '...',
  })

  const pubs = await pubpub.pub.getMany()

  console.log(pubs)
}

main()
```

Replace `https://demo.pubpub.org` with your community URL, and replace `â€¦` with your PubPUb login email address and password, respectively. 

## Limitations

The following actions are not permitted by the SDK, nor through the API in general:

### Creating or deleting communities

Deleting a community is not permitted, due to the risk of accidental deletion of a community. Creating a community is not permitted, due to the potential for abuse (e.g., spam communities).

### Creating, deleting, or modifying users

It is not possible to create, delete or modifying users, due to the risks involved.

## FAQ

### How do I get the ID of my community/page/collection?

You can use the [PubPub ID Finder](https://pubpub.tefkah.com/) to find the ID of a community, page, or collection.

### Can I run this in the browser?

While the SDK was designed to also be run in the browser, we are not yet sending CORS headers correctly, so this may not work.
